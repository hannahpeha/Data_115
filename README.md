All of the columns in the dataset are categorical. I chose to focus my initial analysis on patterns related to the most commonly recalled foods. This bar chart shows the most common reason foods were recalled in the United States from 2017-2020. As seen in the chart, the most common reason a food was recalled was for "Undeclared Milk". An "undeclared" designation means a product did not list the presence of a major food allergen on the finished packaging. The next most common reasons were listeria and potential listeria contamination. Listeria is a food-borne bacterial illness. It is commonly found in unpasteurized milk products and improperly handled deli meats.
